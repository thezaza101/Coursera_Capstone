# Introduction/Business Problem (Week 4 part 1)

The success of a new business depends on a number of factors, one of them is to perform market research. Market research allows a prospective business owner to identify gaps in supply as well as determine if an area has demand for their goods. Doing this research will ensure a new business is set up for success and their hard work does not go to waste, however it is currently very time consuming.

This project aims to identify demand for diffrent types of cuisines based on availability and population demand. The findings will allow new restaurant owners and prospective business owners to decide what type of food they will serve

Note: For the purpose of this project, and scope of this project will only target Canada and be limited to food items.
